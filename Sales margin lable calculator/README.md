## 🪄 Staffing Margin Rule-Based AI  

**Simplicity: Strategy → Rules → Actionable Insights**  

This repository demonstrates how a **business strategy—here, staffing and pricing—can be translated into a simple, rule-based AI solution**. The focus is on **clarity, actionable results, and easy visualization**, not production-ready code.

---

⚡ Purpose
Across organizations, decision-making often relies on intuition or complex calculations. This project shows how to:
- Calculate **staffing margins** in a transparent way
- Highlight **profitable vs low-margin situations**
- Enforce **minimum acceptable margins** to avoid losses
- Guessing the lable based on business rules
- Visualize **margin vs inkoop and verkoop** with warnings

---

✨ Features
- **Rule-based margin calculation** with thresholds:
  - ✅ Profitable (≥10%)
  - ⚠️ Warning (5%-10%) 
- **Readable tables** with left-aligned statuses for clarity  
- **Visualizations**: scatter plots with shaded warning zones  
- **Example scenarios** to demonstrate “what-if” analysis  

*In the real-life case there was a calculater available for sales so the lable could be guessed upfront

**Visualization:**  
- Red circles = Inkoop vs Margin  
- Blue crosses = Verkoop vs Margin  
- Yellow shaded zone = Warning margins (5%-10%)  
- Green line = Target 10% margin  
- Orange line = Minimum 5% margin

🧭 Who This is For
- **Business analysts** and strategists looking for transparent decision tools
- **Data and BI enthusiasts** exploring simple rule-based AI
- **Teams** seeking actionable insights without complex ML models

---

🚫 What This Is Not
- ❌ Production-ready system
- ❌ Complex ML pipeline
- ❌ Proprietary company IP

This project focuses on **illustrative, understandable, and actionable solutions**.

💡 How to Use
1. Clone the repo.  
2. Run the Python script to see **margin calculations and visualizations**.  
3. Adapt the framework and scenarios to your own business context.

**Takeaway:** 
🪄 *Complexity isn’t the enemy — unmanaged complexity is. Sometimes there is no need to implement complex AI models.* 
*Simple rules + clear visualization = quick insights from strategy without unnecessary complexity.*
